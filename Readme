# Code-Samples
Some codes I made to use as examples for Learn2GetHired

These include the only a partial amount of works I have done.  These projects set my basics for each skill and I am learning from my past time.
I would love to send more codes only on request due to some of the privacy issues with my codes.

Some codes that fall under "Private Issues" are Python, Ruby, and C++. I uploaded them in pdf format in order to prevent the reuse of my codes.
Sure people can copy and paste but some of the important codes are missing within the pdf. The effect will be that no errors will pop up even though there are a lot of errors. 

Again, I would love to show more but please contact me to see the full project samples.
